The script takes a number of remote hosts as input and attempts to shut them
down by issuing commands via ssh protocol.

Hosts are specified by the triplet <host_name> <host_ip> <host_password>.
Hosts triplets can be passed to the script by listing them as command-line
arguments or in the "hosts.txt" file with the -f flag.

Hosts parsed from the file and the command-line arguments are collected in an
array and sequentially shutdown.

If the -n <host_number> option is set, only the host with <host_number>
position in the hosts list will be shutdown.

The "install.sh" scripts simply creates a symbolic link to the main script.
By default the link is created in the /usr/local/bin/ directory, this can be
changed by setting the option -i <install_dir>.
